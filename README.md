## Dice Model Specifications

Because the dice model is a model purchased from a store, I am unable to include it in this repository.
However, you can find or create your own model using the specifications as follows:

**Bounding Box**
- Width: 2.454
- Height: 2.463
- Depth: 2.457
- Scale: 0.25, 0.25, 0.25

**Physics Body**
- Mass: 0.5
- Friction: 0.8
- Restitution: 0.8
- Rolling friction: 0.5
- Damping: 0.15
- Angular damping: 0.6
- Charge: 0.2
- Center of Mass: 0.31, 0.304, -0.314
- Collision Detection: Threshold = 0.45
- Resting: ☑️ Allows resting

Ensure that your dice model is a box containing 6 sides, and has a model that reflects a typical 6-sided die's dots.

## Coin Model Specifications

For the same reason as the dice model's exclusion from the repository, I am unable to include the coin model in this repository.
You can find or create your own model using the specifications as follows:

**Bounding Box**
- Width: 2.422
- Height: 0.19
- Depth: 2.421
- Scale: 0.5, 0.5, 0.5

**Physics Body**
- Mass: 5
- Friction: 0.7
- Restitution: 0.8
- Rolling friction: 0.4
- Damping: 0.2
- Angular damping: 0.3
- Charge: 0.2
- Center of Mass: 0, 0, 0.664
- Collision Detection: Threshold = 0.5
- Resting: ☑️ Allows resting

Ensure that your coin model is a cylinder containing 2 unique faces on each end of the cylinder.
